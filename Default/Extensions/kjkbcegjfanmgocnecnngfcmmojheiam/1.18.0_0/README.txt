Privacy Policy for the Chrome Browser Extension 'Favorites'
===========================================================
[
	The Favorites extension DOES NOT collect any personal user data.
	Read on to learn why and what data the extension sends to a web service,
	how it is handled and why this means no harm to your privacy.
]

The Favorites extension lets you view and manage your bookmarked websites depicted as icons.
It also provides optional features that let you search on bookmarked websites and read a website's news feed.

In order to determine the internet addresses (urls) of website icons and (optionally) search pages and news feeds,
the extension queries a web service that provides this information.
This web service is controlled by me (the extension developer) and hosted on a web server provided by the Netcup GmbH in Karlsruhe, Germany.

In order to examine technical problems and possible attacks the web server creates log files which are automatically deleted after 14 days.
These Log files are also used to create anonymous usage statistics.
Read more about these server log files below.



Extension Permissions
=====================

– Mandatory permissions

The Favorites extension offers ...
... a replacement for the new tab page (1)
... that lets you view and manage your bookmarks (2)
... depicted as icons. (3)

Therefore the following extension permissions are mandatory:
(1) 'Replace the page you see when opening a new tab'
(2) 'Read and change your bookmarks'
(3) 'Read the icons of the websites you visit'


– Optional permissions

The Favorites extension optionally offers you functions ....
... to copy, cut & paste bookmarks to and from your clipboard (1)
... and to read a website's news feed. (2)

Therefore the extension might ask for the following optional permissions:
(1) 'Read/Modify data you copy and paste'
(2) 'Read and change your data on <... some website ...>'

Requested permissions are solely used for the aforementioned reasons and not exploited to harm your privacy!


– Default permissions that are not visible to the user

(1) activeTab: ... is used for Javascript-bookmarks ('bookmarklets'). I.e. if bookmarks are shown in a popup a user can use 'bookmarklets' in the current tab.
(2) contextMenus: ... are used for various tasks: Mostly to access the settings window, to enable/disable the popup mode and to select a web image as wallpaper in the new tab page.
(3) storage: ... is used for settings
(4) unlimitedStorage: ... is necessary to store opaque responses/images/icons. Opaque responses have a virtual/'padded' size.
(5) alarms: ... is optionally used to wake up the background page to download updated news feeds
